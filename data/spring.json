Students will develop their drawing skills and understanding of movement, while also exploring the expressive and collaborative aspects of drawing. By the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of work that demonstrates their ability to capture and convey motion through drawing and develop them into digital motion sequences. They will have strong skills in observing, seeing, analyzing, translating, and editing. Through digital editing, they will create film rhythms of their work. Going from live action, pencil to paper, to digital media. "

The tendency for hermetically sealed spaces, isolated from the outside and the public, exclude many people who rarely engage with these institutions. Can museums be more public? Can they be more porous? Visited by over 24 million visitors annually, The National Mall embodies America\u00bfs values and what we choose to both commemorate and teach. These institutions seek to tell the story of our nation through many lenses. Students will find their own story to tell in a new museum on the National Mall. They will analyze the area and select a site that aligns with their museum theme and interests. By combining landscape, site, and context, we will create a series of more inclusive museums. "

There are no municipal utilities on the site. All water, electricity, and cooling must be gathered. The donated site dramatically slopes with a beautiful view of a valley and the ocean below. What is required to design a naturally cooled school made from steel containers in a hot, moist climate? How does building in emerging economies work with sustainable building models? How can pre-made units be modified and used on a challenging building site. How does the goal of creating a school within a supportive community foster respect for the environment, creativity, and active learning fit within a rigid box? Students will experiment with molding the land, natural ventilation, water collection, and modifying the box. This school is the dream of the principal and the head of the board of governors. How does a dream become reality? Drexel students will interact with architecture students from Jamaica during the term and present their projects to the Jamaican principal and board of governors at the end of the term. "

While the care itself comes from trained medical staff, professionals need well designed, thoughtful buildings and spaces to effectively work. This course will help students develop an understanding of how healthcare design can best serve a community in a myriad of ways. Students will be tasked with identifying the healthcare needs of a community and providing a design solution that focuses on the patients\u00bf experience. This studio will take a deep dive into the implementation of FGI Guidelines, healthcare specific building codes, medical planning, and equipment layout. This studio will comprehensively look at exterior and interior design, wayfinding, implementation of concepts from LEED, WELL, and Passive House building standards. This studio includes guest lecturing and integration with healthcare design professionals from HOK\u00bfs Philadelphia office. "

Students will develop their drawing skills and understanding of movement, while also exploring the expressive and collaborative aspects of drawing. By the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of work that demonstrates their ability to capture and convey motion through drawing and develop them into digital motion sequences. They will have strong skills in observing, seeing, analyzing, translating, and editing. Through digital editing, they will create film rhythms of their work.

In this course, students can expect to engage with games from many different genres, including art games (Hair Nah!), casual games (Diner Dash), first-person adventure games (Sunset), and 3D open-world games (Grand Theft Auto). Readings by games studies scholars including Kishonna Gray, Shira Chess, and Amanda Phillips will help us think through how embodied difference shapes how we play with (and are played by) our games. Over the course of the term, students will hone their argumentative and research skills through class presentations, a short midterm paper, and a final project that presents an original analysis of a videogame text for a general audience.

This course will center intersectional feminist approaches to the study of videogames, with a particular emphasis on race and other forms of embodied difference. In this course, students can expect to engage with games from many different genres, including art games (Hair Nah!), casual games (Diner Dash), first-person adventure games (Sunset), and 3D open-world games (Grand Theft Auto). Readings by games studies scholars including Kishonna Gray, Shira Chess, and Amanda Phillips will help us think through how embodied difference shapes how we play with (and are played by) our games. Over the course of the term, students will hone their argumentative and research skills through class presentations, a short midterm paper, and a final project that presents an original analysis of a videogame text for a general audience.

Design teams will focus on developing Playful Learning initiatives for multiple sites, fostering intergenerational interaction and enriching children\u00bfs cognitive and social development in the public spaces they encounter every day. Through assigned readings, lectures, community meetings and design charrettes students will acquire essential skills in community engagement, teamwork, inclusive design and placemaking. Additionally, grant funding has been secured in partnership with Playful Learning Landscapes Action Network, Watchdog and Drexel University, which will lead to the realization of some of the projects. For those interested, students also will have the chance to continue their involvement by participating in construction documentation and implementation activities for academic credit. "

In this course, students can expect to engage with games from many different genres, including art games (Hair Nah!), casual games (Diner Dash), first-person adventure games (Sunset), and 3D open-world games (Grand Theft Auto). Readings by games studies scholars including Kishonna Gray, Shira Chess, and Amanda Phillips will help us think through how embodied difference shapes how we play with (and are played by) our games. Over the course of the term, students will hone their argumentative and research skills through class presentations, a short midterm paper, and a final project that presents an original analysis of a videogame text for a general audience.

With it, we will also investigate scholarship bearing out the \"\"wild\"\" methodologies and analyses that inform these experimental expressions -- from critical fabulation to mystic self-invention, from boundary-blurring black eco-poetics to a radical, everyday praxis of  \"\"deviance.\"\"\u00a0Together, we will engage the work of Akwaeke Emezi, Sun-Ra, M. Nourbese Philip, the St. John Coltrane Church, Henry Dumas, Kamau Braithwaite, Cameron Rowland, Kara Walker, maroon legends like Bras Coup\u00e9 and geographies like the Great Dismal Swamp, and much, much more.

In this class, we will study how neuronal cell biology is disrupted in known forms of autism, and how distinct forms of autism can arise from alterations in common cellular pathways. Further, we will discuss how these discoveries may lead to eventual treatments or cures. "

        "description": "Autism disorders arise from changes in neurodevelopment that deeply affect how individuals interact with the world around them.  As study of autism has increased over the past several decades, it has become clear that autism actually comprises a large, heterogeneous set of similar disorders, most of which are genetic in origin.  In this class, we will study how neuronal cell biology is disrupted in known forms of autism, and how distinct forms of autism can arise from alterations in common cellular pathways.  Further, we will discuss how these discoveries may lead to eventual treatments or cures.  Classes will include both lectures and discussion of recent papers from the scientific literature. "

The course integrates the community needs assessment methodology with the urban disorder literature to educate students in the modes of observation required to reliably measure crime, disorder, surveillance gaps, and other sources of community risk. Students will map community demographic features, develop an assessment tool, make field observations, and analyze the findings as part of their culminating experience. "

As a result, misinformed citizens may draw erroneous conclusions about crime, people who commit crime, and crime policies. Mass media and pop culture often misrepresent the complexity of crime and reality of those involved in the criminal justice system. Students will view popular media outlets and evaluate the legitimacy and efficacy of the sources while analyzing the accuracy of criminogenic factors and the criminal justice system as portrayed in movies, memes, podcast, and television shows.

With it, we will also investigate scholarship bearing out the \"\"wild\"\" methodologies and analyses that inform these experimental expressions -- from critical fabulation to mystic self-invention, from boundary-blurring black eco-poetics to a radical, everyday praxis of  \"\"deviance.\"\"\u00a0Together, we will engage the work of Akwaeke Emezi, Sun-Ra, M.

Questions we will explore through literary excerpts, articles from the press, videos and films include: What does food mean to the French?  How does food relate to French identities and power structures? How does food function as a political, cultural, and social tool in France?  How does food connect the past, present and future in France? Taught in French. "

This course aims to examine the economic, political, and cultural causes behind the lack of democracy in the region, and will expose students to contrasting perspectives on the topic including structural and cultural arguments. Amongst other examples, we will examine the role of the US, the impact of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on democracy in the region, and the role of Islamic and women\u00bfs movements in the recent Arab uprisings. The course will cover Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran among others. "

What are these silences? What forces might be moving behind them? What hidden languages can we find when we question the silences? How do these silences affect our perception of the continent today? What are the ramifications in  the world today? "

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther, have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions. "

We study the general context of the 1930's and 1940's, the perpetrators and their relevant ideology and administrative systems, the victims and intended victims, and also the \"bystanders\", those among whom the round-ups and extermination took place in Europe as well as in the US. The materials include historical documents, memoirs, and historical accounts, and a variety of films. "

Amongst other examples, we will examine the role of the US, the impact of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict on democracy in the region, and the role of Islamic and women\u00bfs movements in the recent Arab uprisings.

Christianity is often considered to be diametrically opposed to Judaism, to be a rejection of the Judaic worldview. Indeed, prominent thinkers in the history of Christianity, such as Martin Luther,  have reinforced this position. Yet Christianity was originally a development within Judaism, a sect, so to speak, of Judaism. The earliest Christians were Jewish followers of a Jewish leader and conceived of themselves as faithful Jews. So how did the two religions come to be viewed as opposed? Do elements of Judaism remain as part of the foundation of the new faith of Christianity? Where do the two faiths converge and where do they diverge? This course endeavors to answer these important questions. "

The course begins by introducing several examples of supervised and unsupervised learning. Beginning with well-established techniques, we discuss methods such as discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and clustering techniques. The second half of class is devoted to Big Data or high dimensional data analysis using dimension reduction and variable selection techniques. In addition to reading papers demonstrating the use of these techniques in behavioral research, we will provide step-by-step tutori "

We will examine social trends in medical knowledge and practice as well as how illness categories are created, negotiated, and resisted.

This course will focus on the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, an under-examined area of the Americas that comprises a plethora of expressions of \"Afrolatinidades.\" Students will analyze and discuss Caribbean folk tales, interviews, documentaries, music, dancing, and other artistic expressions to recenter and recover the Black roots of Latinx history. At the end of the term, students will have a better understanding of the evolving Latinx cultural and ethnic identities that also include these Caribbean voices. Taught in Spanish. "

Because data and analytics are an important component of digital marketing, students will also become proficient at using data to evaluate a marketing campaign. One of the best ways to assess marketing strategies is through A/B testing and students will become expert at planning, analyzing and reporting A/B tests.

Software defined radio uses general purpose radio hardware that can be programmed in software to implement different communication standards. We will begin by discussing the basic principles of wireless radio frequency transmissions and leverage this knowledge to build analog and digital communication systems. Knowledge of these techniques and systems will provide a platform that can be used in the class project for further exploration of wireless networking topics such as cybersecurity, cognitive radio, smart cities, and the Internet of Things.

The course starts with how understanding of light spectrum that is generated due to heat started the development of the field of quantum mechanics by Max Planck. This is then expanded by Einstein to include a quantum theory of light, on which basis absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission are explained. Building on that work, we analyze light interaction with semiconductors and show how lasers, LEDs and photodetectors work, and how modern photonics is able to solve great challenges of humanity. "

Once a satisfactory design is found, the same code is used to implement the system in a hardware system. The course will expand on students\u00bf Simulink Skills both in modeling of a system and computer control of the system using commercial hardware. It is a project-based course thar utilizes Simulink for modeling and simulation and then the Simulink Arduino Interface to implement various systems using physical hardware. "

The purpose is to understand the sociopolitical complexities surrounding a policy issue so advocates can more effectively communicate research evidence and advance policy changes that improve population health. Policy outcomes research is focused on generating knowledge about the impacts that policies produce. The purpose is to determine the outcomes that are directly attributable to a specific policy, not other factors. "

Policy process research is focused on generating knowledge about the contemporary, \"real world\" contexts in which health policy decisions are made. The purpose is to understand the sociopolitical complexities surrounding a policy issue so advocates can more effectively communicate research evidence and advance policy changes that improve population health. Policy outcomes research is focused on generating knowledge about the impacts that policies produce. The purpose is to determine the outcomes that are directly attributable to a specific policy, not other factors. "

Grounded in a social justice perspective, this course encourages critical thinking about health outcomes framed by the broad context of the political and social environment. This course offers a hands-on opportunity for students to explore what it means to be civically engaged since they are required to engage in 40 hours of service in the community throughout Spring Quarter. The goals are to support understanding of complex health issues and to empower students in their development as agents of positive change. This course will draw heavily on students' involvement in service and will weave these together with elements of other academic coursework and future academic/career goals. "

Here, the distinction between science and art are often blurred; lawyers turn into impassioned orators, and new fields of scientific inquiry are created in real time. These spaces highlight how rhetorically situated the categories of art and science really are. Even the term forensics marries them, defined by Merriam Webster as:       1. Plural: the art or study of argumentative discourse    2. Plural: the application of scientific knowledge to legal problems        For much of the composing required in college, students are asked to provide compelling evidence. This course seeks to answer the question: \u00bfBut what makes evidence compelling?\u00bf Students will analyze texts, videos, and podcasts in crime genres to build criteria and evaluate their effectiveness, just like members of a jury.\" "

They will share life on their campus and in their cities/countries as well. Students will look at global issues surrounding the United Nations\u00bf Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG\u00bfs) and how international organizations can use these for impactful and beneficial purposes economically and socially. They will work on multi-week projects, based on topic themes such as cultural stereotypes, interacting professionally across cultural organizations, to better understand global exchanges based on cultural differences, similarities and needs, underscored in purpose-driven responsibility.  Teams will exchange ideas both in the written and verbal modes and through presentations with global partners. Assessment will include meaningful contribution, reflective exercises, class discussions, as well as the GC project deliverables For the Spring 2024 term, partner universities will be the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands and the University of Montevideo in Uruguay.

        "description": "The origin story of Philadelphia begins with a plague. In the winter of 1665, the city of London was struck down with an epidemic of the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Hosted by fleas carried by rats across its refuse-choked streets and sewers, it caused a horrific and typically fatal disease in its human victims. Tens of thousands died. The next year, a wildfire precipitated by overcrowding and antiquated planning destroyed large swaths of the city. Commerce dragged to a standstill. These cascading urban traumas left an impression on the twenty-one-year-old William Penn. Years later, now the governor and chartered proprietor of the vast Pennsylvania colony, his designs for Philadelphia imagined a \"green country town which will never be burnt and always be wholesome.\" In this community-based learning course, we will look back at the promise of Philadelphia as a garden city through the lens of its present struggles with food insecurity, lethal heat islands, an opioid crisis, and green gentrification. Readings and discussions of archival materials, public planning reports, and environmental justice literature will prepare us for biweekly site visits, hands-on activities, and direct engagement with the people working to reconcile this promise in their everyday lives.
